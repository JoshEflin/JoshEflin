- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... A new portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...   Go, lua
- I'm working my way through "Writing an Interpreter in Go", and translating it into typescript as I go to make sure I have an adequate understanding of the functionality 
  with the end goal being to build a recursive descent parser that works in both go and typescript 
- I'm using the typescript lexer to aid in parser commands in my terminal emulating portfolio
